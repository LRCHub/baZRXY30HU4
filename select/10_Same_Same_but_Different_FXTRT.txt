Here you cut out my fin
How am i supposed to swim ashore
When I'm drowning

Feeling Indigo
I feel Indigo

1, 2, 3, Go!!

(Same Same But Different)
I can't make you stay
(Same Same But Different)
You push me away
(Same Same But Different)
It'll all be okay

You taught me how to swim
Showed me how to use my fins
You taught me how to float
But I'm stuck inside this human boat

(Same Same But Different)
I can't make you stay
(Same Same But Different)
You push me away
(Same Same But Different)
It'll all be okay
